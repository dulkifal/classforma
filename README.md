 Once the user clicks on one of the document link in Page 1,  then a pdf will be open aside,

 Once on this page, the user can click on one of the labels and activate that label. Then the user should be able to annotate the document content. Annotation means basically creating rectangular regions on the document. For example, the user activates on 'Title' label by clicking and draws a rectangle over the paper title text in the document. This rectangle is shown on the document and the box coordinates should then show up in the 'Boxes' section of the page. Save these annotations in local storage and existing annotations should be loaded when the user closes and opens the document page again.
